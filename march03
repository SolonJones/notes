1. the UK market was 10% more expensive than the US 
    1. ealier inflation policy make the UK domestic cost raise
    2. assume both uk and us are to compete in global market:
        us cost 100 usd to produce one unit 
        uk cost 100 str to produce one unit 
        1 uk == 0.9 usd 
        then 3rd party buyer will choose us goods for sure 
    3. if both us and uk need to import raw material for productions:
        us cost 50 usd to import one unit 
        uk cost 50 str to import one unit 
        1 str = 1.1 usd
        then uk can import much more than us for the same price 
    4. now consider the uk labor cost was 10% more than that of us 
        us cost 100 dollar to produce 
        uk cost 110 strerling to produce 
        1 str == 1.1 usd 
        us cost 50 dollar to import 
        uk cost 50x0.9 = 45 sterling to import 
        then us total cost = 100 + 50 = 150 gld
        then uk total cost = 110 + 45 =155 *1.1 gld 


key: consider how the currency exchange rate of UK was infecting the UK economy back in 1925
