this file test split code into mutiple pieces and complie them togather 

main.c is the drive file 
in order to use the file hello.c later, include
: include"hello.h"

hello.h is the header file 
: the declearation of void hello(str);

function is in hello_fn.c file 
: include"hello.h"
: include<stdio.h>
: function defination 

------------------------
we know above works : 
rules: 
	1. function.h must match function name




-------------------------

test:
main : header local.h function_name local()
header: declare local()
hello.c: define local()

still works: the file name of fucntion.c is not important 
what is important is the header name must equal to function name 


--------------------------

summary: 

	1. ignore above conclusion
	2. main.c include "local.h" instruct complier to search declaration inside local.h first when compling the code 
	3. since hello.c also include local.h, complier can combine them togather when try to solve the defination of void hello(). 
	4. it has nothing to do with the naming of header file or actual funcitons files.
