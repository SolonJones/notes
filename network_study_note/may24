=====
hubs
=====


hubs : multiport repeater 
hubs : central of collision domain 
hubs : half-deplex CSMA/CD 
hubs port : Rx + Tx 
hubs : 
	1. host send frame on Tx1 -> hubs 
	2. hubs port Tx1 recieve 
	3. hubs regenereate n-1 on ports Rx(2~n) 
	4. hosts(2~n) recieve on Rx 
crossover : connect 1 hub Rx to another Tx with cable 

! : fast ethernet can only use 2 hubs max 

hubs : no configuration 



======
bridge
======

bridge : segment the network 
bridge : use laye2 MAC address 
bridge : central of broadcast domain 
bridge : connect collision domain 
flood : only if MAC table has no record 
port : connect to hub or a bus_line of hosts 
MAC table : 1 port - 2 or more address 

================
ethernet switch
================


ethernet switch : similar to bridge 
ethernet swtich : larger MAC table 
port : connect to signle host 
MAC table : 1 port - 1 MAC address 
collision : only if port ooperate on half-duplex, collide with itself
MAC table : made by content addressable memory 
CAM : content addressable memory 
CAM table : MAC table 


switch brands : 
	1. cisco 
	2. HP 
	3. Huawei 
	4. uniper 
	5. Arista 
	6. Linksys 
	7. D-link 
	8. NetGear 
	9. Nec 

switch types : 
	1. managed 
	2. unmanaged 
	3. stackable 
	4. modular 
	5. fixed 
	6. desktop 
	7. rack-mounted 


autonegotiate : switch port automatically negatioate conneciton mode with host 


port monitor : switch allow forward and monitor 


switching loop : flooded frame circulate network perpetially 

broadcast strom : same 

STP : spaning tree protocol 
STP : organize layer 2 device into hierarchy 
STP : {ID priority, MAC}
BPDU : bridge protocol data unit 
BPDU : frame used by STP to identify each port on each bridge 
bridge : most commonly used layer 2 device (replaced by switch)
root bridge : lowest id, faster backbone speed 
root port : any port (on non-root bridge) that connect(direct/indirect) to root bridge 
root port : port on regular bridge and link to root bridge 
designated port : port link to down stream network without loop 
designated port : port on root bridge link to regular bridge 
blocking port : port created a loop 
non-designated port : blocking port 
* see pic on page 52

port state : 
	1. bloakcing 
	2. listing 
	3. learning 
	4, forwarding 
	5. disabled 

converged : all ports on all bridge are in forwarind or blocking states 

RSTP : rapid STP
