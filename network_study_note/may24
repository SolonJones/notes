=====
hubs
=====


hubs : multiport repeater 
hubs : central of collision domain 
hubs : half-deplex CSMA/CD 
hubs port : Rx + Tx 
hubs : 
	1. host send frame on Tx1 -> hubs 
	2. hubs port Tx1 recieve 
	3. hubs regenereate n-1 on ports Rx(2~n) 
	4. hosts(2~n) recieve on Rx 
crossover : connect 1 hub Rx to another Tx with cable 

! : fast ethernet can only use 2 hubs max 

hubs : no configuration 



======
bridge
======

bridge : segment the network 
bridge : use laye2 MAC address 
bridge : central of broadcast domain 
bridge : connect collision domain 
flood : only if MAC table has no record 
port : connect to hub or a bus_line of hosts 
MAC table : 1 port - 2 or more address 

================
ethernet switch
================


ethernet switch : similar to bridge 
ethernet swtich : larger MAC table 
port : connect to signle host 
MAC table : 1 port - 1 MAC address 
collision : only if port ooperate on half-duplex, collide with itself
MAC table : made by content addressable memory 
CAM : content addressable memory 
CAM table : MAC table 


switch brands : 
	1. cisco 
	2. HP 
	3. Huawei 
	4. uniper 
	5. Arista 
	6. Linksys 
	7. D-link 
	8. NetGear 
	9. Nec 

switch types : 
	1. managed 
	2. unmanaged 
	3. stackable 
	4. modular 
	5. fixed 
	6. desktop 
	7. rack-mounted 


autonegotiate : switch port automatically negatioate conneciton mode with host 


port monitor : switch allow forward and monitor 


switching loop : flooded frame circulate network perpetially 

broadcast strom : same 

STP : spaning tree protocol 
STP : organize layer 2 device into hierarchy 
STP : {ID priority, MAC}
BPDU : bridge protocol data unit 
BPDU : frame used by STP to identify each port on each bridge 
bridge : most commonly used layer 2 device (replaced by switch)
root bridge : lowest id, faster backbone speed 
root port : any port (on non-root bridge) that connect(direct/indirect) to root bridge 
root port : port on regular bridge and link to root bridge 
designated port : port link to down stream network without loop 
designated port : port on root bridge link to regular bridge 
blocking port : port created a loop 
non-designated port : blocking port 
* see pic on page 52

port state : 
	1. bloakcing 
	2. listing 
	3. learning 
	4, forwarding 
	5. disabled 

converged : all ports on all bridge are in forwarind or blocking states 

RSTP : rapid STP 




Mon 24 May 2021 04:13:24 PM EDT

RSTP : discarding = blocking + listening + disable 
BPDU : 

==============================
this section is cisco specific 
==============================
access port : port on bridge/swtich connect to host 
topology change : when bridge added, repalced, remvoed, the core network topology change. access port remind same 
portFast : Cisco configuration prevent access port flush caused by core topology changed 
edgePort : non core port 
BPDU guard : cmd a port to act portFast 
BPDU filter : drop all BPDU frame 
Root guard : prevent a switch to become root or root core group 

! confustion in ventor naming convention and virtual switch naming 




=========
PoE
========

POE : power over ethernet 
poe : supply power on ethernet 
802.3af : 13W 350mA @ 48V
802.3af+ : 25W 600mA
PSE : power sourcung equipment 
power injector : enable ehternet switch convert to power 



=======================
compare topology 
======================


topploly : physical + logical 
physical : node connection with mediam physically 
logical : flow of data via network 

point to point link : between 2 nodes, phycical or logical 


pysical bus : 2+ nodes share access media 
cable taps : link node onto a shared media 
terminator : at each end of bus 
repeater : connect 2 bus for long distance 
T ---- N -----N ------T 


logical bus : one node data is reachable to all other connect nodes, regardless of physical topology 
physical star : end nodes connect to central node 
hub and spoke : same as star 

pysical star - logical bus : central node use hub 
physical star - logical star : central node use bridge or switch 

physical ring : 

A--- B 
|    |
C--- D 	


Token ring : ? 

meth : each device have end to end with all other device 
meth : partial mesh is used in reality 
parital mesh : subnet partial mesh with each other 




===========================
network types lan wan etc ..
===========================


LAN : practically defiend by geolocation 
LAN : wide range 
LAN : 
	1. residentail network
	2. soho 
	3. sme : small medium enterprise 
	4. enterprice 
	5. CAN : campust area network 
	6. WLAN : wireless LAN 
	7. hotspot : open WLAN 
	8. SAN : storage area network

WAN : link LAN 
WAN : leased network device and link 

internet : world wide WAN on tcp/ip 
intranet : closed WAN or LAN 
extranet : parital open intranet 

PAN : use bluetooth or other medim 
WPAN : wireless PAN 

scalability : easy add/remove of end nodes and core nodes 
adaptability : easy upgrade or change of service 

hierarchical model : break down complex network into functional small section 
distributed switching : common hiearchical model 
distributed switching : divide by geolocaiton, grouped under access switch. access switch connect to distribution layer,which forward info. 

Cisco model : access -> distribution -> core -> data center 

access layer : connect to end point | connect to distribution layer 
distribution layer : connect to access layer | to other distribution layer | to the core layer | to data center 
core layer : to core | to distribution | to WAN router 
data center : servie as aythentication, addressing , name resolution, application servers, storage 

device : 
router : layer 3 forward with less port 
layer3 switch : layer 3 forward with more port 
aggregation switch : high end layer3 switch 
top of rack : layer 3 switch for racking up

modular block : at each layer, divide into functional blocks 

SDN : software defiend networking 
SDN : divide network via planes 
	1. control plane : how trafiic should be prioritzed and forwarded 
	2. data planes : handle the actual forwarding and authentication 
	3. management plane : monitor traffic condition and network status 
network controller : applicaiton implement control plane onto data planes, using device API  

control plane 
	| northnound API
controller   ------------ management  
	| southnound API 
     device		

porvisioning : automated deployment of network links
