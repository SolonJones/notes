To whom it may concern:

I am writing in regards to the linux system administration position in Calgary office. 

My name is Alan Liu and I graduated from the University of Windsor this April. I changed my career path to IT after working 3 years in the field of finance, and completed my third degree in computer science with a 93/100 GPA last year. 

I have 2 years of experience running linux, mostly as a personal work station or a NFS. I am passionate about the technology and is currently pursing a certification in PWK. My previous job as an equity trader prepared me well in working under time pressure and my exposure as operation manager directly managing 500+ millions dollors sharpen my attention towards details. 

I full understand the disadvantage of a short IT career track which I am facing, but I believe my past skills gained are transferanle and my study also perpared me for the challenge ahead. 


I look forward to speaking with you and futher discuss how I can be of value to your team. 

Faithfully, 
Alan Liu
